 *** Bismark methylation extractor version v0.18.0 ***

Setting option '--no_overlap' since this is (normally) the right thing to do for paired-end data

Setting core usage to single-threaded (default). Consider using --multicore <int> to speed up the extraction process.

Summarising Bismark methylation extractor parameters:
===============================================================
Bismark paired-end SAM format specified (default)
Number of cores to be used: 1
Strand-specific outputs will be skipped. Separate output files for cytosines in CpG, CHG and CHH context will be generated
Output will be written to the current directory ('/home/qszhu/workspace/5.rrbs_study/1.align/t11.bismark1')


Summarising bedGraph parameters:
===============================================================
Generating additional output in bedGraph and coverage format
bedGraph format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage>
coverage format:	<Chromosome> <Start Position> <End Position> <Methylation Percentage> <count methylated> <count non-methylated>

Using a cutoff of 1 read(s) to report cytosine positions
Reporting and sorting cytosine methylation information in CpG context only (default)
The bedGraph UNIX sort command will use the following memory setting:	'2G'. Temporary directory used for sorting is the output directory

Checking file >>t11.R1_bismark_bt2_pe.bam<< for signs of file truncation...


Now testing Bismark result file t11.R1_bismark_bt2_pe.bam for positional sorting (which would be bad...)	...passed!
